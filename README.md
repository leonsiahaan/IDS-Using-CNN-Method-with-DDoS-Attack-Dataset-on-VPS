# IDS-Using-CNN-Method-with-DDoS-Attack-Dataset-on-VPS
Undergraduate thesis project. project was made for research purpose only :

1. Testing security and attacks using VPS services
2. The attacks used as trials are DDoS attacks, namely: UDP flood, TCP flood, and ICMP flood.
3. DDoS attacks are carried out with a duration of 20 minutes and Benign or Normal pings are carried out with a duration of 10 minutes.
4. The network log during the trial was recorded using the Wireshark tool and then extracted using the CICFlowMeter 4.0 tool to obtain a dataset in CSV format.
5. The method used in classifying is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
